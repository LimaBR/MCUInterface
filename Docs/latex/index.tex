 Open source alternative to the use of Lab\+VIEW and MATLAB for receiving and sending data to microcontrollers attached by a USB port.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Motivation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
When code is being developed to be run on microcontrollers, one of the difficulties faced by the engineer is to see the data that is being read by a sensor or processed by the microcontroller. Sometimes, debug tools like GDB or Open\+OCD are not available, so, scanf and printf would be the best alternatives to be used for data input and output from the code. The Arduino IDE already has a built in \char`\"{}\+Serial Monitor\char`\"{}, but it can only input and output text and numbers on text format, or plot a chart with very limited functionality.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Description}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The functionality is similar to the front panel of a Lab\+VIEW VI, with controls, indicators, charts and graphs used to create a graphical interface for the program that is running on the microcontroller. Data is sent and received from the microcontroller using a Serial Port protocol, usually through a USB attached virtual COM port.
